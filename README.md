TODOs:

- Create a React app with Tailwind that simulates a very basic Kanban board

- Create small commits as you go:

- Implement drag-and-drop functionality using react-beautiful-dnd or dnd-kit.

- Form validation using zod for adding/editing tasks.

- React Context API or Redux Toolkit (RTK)

- Use a mock backend (use whatever is easiest) with the following endpoints to interact with cards:
  - GET /tasks – Get all tasks.
  - POST /tasks – Add a task.
  - PUT /tasks/:id – Update a task.
  - DELETE /tasks/:id – Delete a task.

- Bonus Points:
  - Create container builds for the frontend and backend
  - Create a deployment for a generic K8s cluster (Kind or Docker Desktop for example)
  
- Publish via GitHub
